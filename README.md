# Churn-Analytics

Customer retention is a top priority for almost any organization. Acquiring new customers is always more expensive than maintaining
existing ones. Gaining an understanding of the reasons customers churn and estimating the risk associated with individual customers
are both powerful components of designing a data-driven retention strategy. Thus, being able to investigate and predict churn rate
is highly valuable to any customer centric organization. 

In this project I have performed EDA and predictive modelling on the IBM's Teleco Customer Churn Dataset. The dataset consists of the
following info:

1)Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
2)Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection,
tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
3)Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and
total charges.
4)Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

Churn_Analytics.md and Churn_Analytics.Rmd consist of  the same code. Only difference is that outputs can be reviewed in md while a detailed step by step walk through is given in the Rmd file.
